Raw audio in FFmpeg can take several different "forms"

for instance:

* pcm_s16le PCM means "traditional wave like format" (raw bytes, basically).  16 means 16 bits per sample, le means "little endian", s means "signed"
* pcm_s32le same but 32 bits per sample.

You can see a list, like:

Basically these represent raw audio types.

Other types include

* pcm_bluray, which can be at least 24 bit, possibly other bit rates.
